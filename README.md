**Poe Trade Plus** is a browser extension that injects a native companion sidebar into the official Path of Exile trade site. It combines bookmark management, search history, search-result enhancements, and quality-of-life trading tools in a single Svelte + TypeScript extension built with WXT.

The project currently focuses on making recurring trade searches easier to save, revisit, compare, and navigate without leaving the official site.

## Features

### Sidebar workflow

- **Integrated trade sidebar:** Poe Trade Plus mounts directly inside `pathofexile.com/trade`.
- **Resizable layout:** the sidebar width can be adjusted and persisted locally.
- **Minimize and restore mode:** collapse the panel into a floating pill to recover screen space.
- **Left or right docking:** choose which side of the trade site the panel should live on.
- **Trade-site-aware layout shift:** the page adapts to the sidebar width so the official site remains usable.

### Bookmarks and folders

- **Version-aware folders:** bookmarks are separated by Path of Exile trade version.
- **Folder creation and inline organization:** create, rename, expand, collapse, archive, and delete folders in place.
- **Drag and drop reordering:** reorder folders and searches without leaving the panel.
- **Per-folder import:** paste a serialized folder string and restore it instantly.
- **Backup and restore:** export all folders to a `.txt` backup file and restore them later.
- **Archived view:** switch between active and archived folders without losing saved searches.

### Search history and navigation

- **Automatic trade history:** visited searches are tracked and stored locally.
- **Active-tab integration:** reopening a saved history entry updates the current trade tab instead of spawning extra tabs.
- **Version filtering:** history entries are filtered to the currently detected trade version.

### Result enhancements

- **Equivalent pricing:** optionally show chaos and divine equivalents using live `poe.ninja` currency ratios.
- **Search-stat highlighting:** active stat filters are highlighted in the result list.
- **Socket breakpoint warnings:** armor results can display max-socket warnings based on item level.
- **Scroll back to result:** pinned-result navigation can scroll the active result list to a specific item.

### Filter helpers

- **Finer Filters integration:** add or exclude modifiers directly from hovered result stats.
- **Grouped quick actions:** includes pseudo and explicit presets such as resistance/life, attack weapon, and spell weapon filters.
- **Regex-friendly search inputs:** native trade-site search inputs automatically get the `~` prefix when appropriate.

### Settings and local persistence

- **Sidebar position preference**
- **Equivalent pricing visibility toggle**
- **Persistent sidebar width**
- **Local browser storage for settings, folders, and history**
- **Ephemeral caching for `poe.ninja` currency ratios**

## Tech Stack

- **WXT** for browser extension structure and MV3 integration
- **Svelte 5** for the injected UI
- **TypeScript** for extension and domain logic
- **Sass** for theming and trade-site layout enhancements
- **Chrome Extension APIs** for storage, tab coordination, and background requests

## Development

### Requirements

- Node.js
- npm

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development build

```bash
npm run dev
```

Load the generated development output from `build/chrome-mv3` in your browser's extensions page.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

This build step also runs the local version bump script before generating the final extension bundle.

The unpacked production extension is generated in `build/chrome-mv3`.

### Package the extension

```bash
npm run package
```

This command creates browser-specific zip files in `build/`, such as `poe-trade-plus-1.0.70-chrome.zip` and `poe-trade-plus-1.0.70-firefox.zip`.
